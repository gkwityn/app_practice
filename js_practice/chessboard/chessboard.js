Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
= 8 and change the program so that it works for any size , outputting a grid
of the given width and height.
